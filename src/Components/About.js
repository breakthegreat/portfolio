  I have developed a strong passion for computer programming,
  acquiring skills in a range of programming languages and technologies
  including SQL, GitHub, JavaScript, Java, C++, C, Python, Numpy,
  Matplotlib, PyTorch, Jax. My main focus is Web Development as it is in
  my opinion a critical role in 2024. I am currently learning ReactJs,

  skills.
  
  I have applied these skills in several projects, notably
  creating a web application using HTML/CSS, JavaScript (jQuery), PHP,
